## Bio

Guorui Xiao is currently a final year student in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Los Angeles completing a Masterâ€™s degree. During his time at UCLA, he was very fortunate to work with Professor [Lixia Zhang](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~lixia/) on topics related to Network Protocol and Named Data Networking and with Professor [Carlo Zaniolo](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~zaniolo/) on topics related to Database and Datastream.

He is actively applying for Ph.D. programs starting in Fall 2023. His research interests lie in the Database, Datastream, Network, and Machine Learning systems, with the ultimate goal of building scalable data-intensive systems. Feel free to reach out to me!
